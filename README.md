## Usage

To use the application, click the button to choose a file to share, then you may enter a password if needed. After clicking share, you will be redirected to another page with a link to your file. Going to this link will allow you to download the file, but if the file has a password, the user must enter the password first. Incorrect password will not allow the user to proceed.
